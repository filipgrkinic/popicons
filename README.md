## Get Popicons via Figma

Popicons is available as a Figma community plugin at:

- https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1293959934134570572/popicons

## Get Popicons via NPM

Using NPM (recommended), run one of the following commands:

```
npm i @popicons/svg
npm i @popicons/react
npm i @popicons/react-native
```

Using Yarn, run one of the following commands:

```
yarn add @popicons/svg
yarn add @popicons/react
yarn add @popicons/react-native
```

For React developers, use `@popicons/react`. For React Native developers, use `@popicons/react-native`. If for some reason you need SVGs, use `@popicons/svg`.

### Upgrade using NPM

To upgrade using NPM, simply reinstall the package:

```
npm i @popicons/svg@latest
npm i @popicons/react@latest
npm i @popicons/react-native@latest
```

Using Yarn:

```
yarn add @popicons/svg
yarn add @popicons/react
yarn add @popicons/react-native
```

### Import Popicons from NPM

To import Popicons when installed using NPM, use the following syntax:

```tsx
import { PopiconsHomeLine, PopiconsHomeSolid, PopiconsHomeDuotone } from "@popicons/react"

function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <PopiconsHomeLine className="icon" />
      <PopiconsHomeSolid style={{ width: 32, height: 32 }} />
      <PopiconsHomeDuotone className="icon" style={{ width: 32, height: 32 }} />
    </>
  )
}
```

Popicons are named using the following convention:

```
Popicons{IconName}{Variant}
```

By typing `<Popicons` VS Code, auto-complete should list all available icons.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Popicons is packaged in such a way as to enable tree shaking. No barrel files are used. This means your dev server should only bundle the icons you actually use.

## Get Popicons Pro via the NPM CLI

Using NPM (recommended):

```
npx i --save-dev popicons@latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the `@latest` is required to ensure you get the latest version of the command-line interface.

Please refer to the NPM CLI for more information:

```

  Usage

    npx popicons@latest upgrade             Upgrade to Popicons Pro
    npx popicons@latest login               Log in to Popicons Pro
    npx popicons@latest logout              Log out of Popicons Pro
    npx popicons@latest ls                  List Popicons
    npx popicons@latest i                   Install Popicons
    npx popicons@latest request-icon        Request a Popicons icon
    npx popicons@latest request-icon-set    Request a custom icon set

```

To quickly install Popicons as React TypeScript, simply run the following commands:

```
npx popicons@latest login
npx popicons@latest i --outdir=src/popicons --framework=react-tsx
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the NPM CLI saves icons as source code e.g. `popicons.tsx`, so that it's easier to move between devices. You can technically set `--outdir` to `--outdir=node_modules` but this is not recommended because icons won't automatically be installed when calling `npm i`.

### Import Popicons from the NPM CLI

To import Popicons when installed using the NPM CLI, use the following syntax:

```tsx
import { PopiconsHomeLine, PopiconsHomeSolid, PopiconsHomeDuotone } from "./popicons/popicons"

function Component() {
  return (
    <>
      <PopiconsHomeLine className="icon" />
      <PopiconsHomeSolid style={{ width: 32, height: 32 }} />
      <PopiconsHomeDuotone className="icon" style={{ width: 32, height: 32 }} />
    </>
  )
}
```

Popicons are named using the following convention:

```
Popicons{IconName}{Variant}
```

By typing `<Popicons` VS Code, auto-complete should list all available icons.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that Popicons is packaged in such a way as to enable tree shaking. No barrel files are used. This means your dev server should only bundle the icons you actually use.

### Upgrade using the NPM CLI

To upgrade using the NPM CLI, simply run the following command:

```
npx popicons@latest i --outdir=src/popicons --framework=react-tsx --force
```

Note that the `--force` command is used to overwrite `src/popicons`. You may also delete `src/popicons` manually and retry without the force command.
